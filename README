nodemoo - A multi-player text adventure written in node.js

It's kinda like a MUD or a MOO, and best resembles a multi-player
text aventure. Oh, and it's written in Javascript.

This is the core engine, and a few example rooms.

It's very incomplete, yet, give me time.

= Implemented =

 * Rooms
 * Room chat
 * Private chat (whisper)
 * Emote
 * Basic navigation ("go north" or "n")
 * Mixins
 * Basic world config

TODO:

 * Items
 * Inventory
 * Light
 * Stats
 * Real users (who can log in again, etc.)
 * Persistence
 * Permissions
 * Other OO patterns?
 * Lots of other stuff
